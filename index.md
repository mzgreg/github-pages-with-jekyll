# Welcome to my blog

Hi, I’m Megan! A Technical Writer who is learning Python to either expand my technical writing abilities or make the full transition to become a Python or Software Developer. Though my future role is uncertain, something I know for sure is that I LOVE building things with my mind! I’ll be using this blog as a means to problem solve and project build as I learn Python.
