Hi, I’m Megan! A Technical Writer who is learning Python to expand my writing capabilities and potentially transition to become a Python or Software Developer. During this journey, I’ve discovered how passionate I am about using technology to solve problems as well as how much I LOVE building things with my mind! I use this blog as a means to problem solve and project build as I master Python (with caffeine in hand).
